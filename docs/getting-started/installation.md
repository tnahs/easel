# Installation

## Create an Environment

Create a project directory with a new virtual environment:

``` shell

$ cd my-easel
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

## Activate the Environment

Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.
