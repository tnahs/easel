# Installation

## Create an Environment

Create a project directory with a new virtual environment:

``` console
$ mkdir my-easel
$ cd my-easel
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

## Activate the Environment

Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

``` console

```

Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

## Install Easel

Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Easel:
